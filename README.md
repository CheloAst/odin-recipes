 With this repository I seek to practice my HTML skills and the use of Git and Github. 
 This project is part of the Project Odin curriculum, it consists of developing a website with different recipes, in this way practice and demonstrate the skills that were taught in the previous lessons, about the HTML language and the use of Git and Github.
